# SubItem2LayerName
Similar to "Release to Layers" command, except that it promotes each item as a parent layer and uses the individual item's name as the layer name. This has been personally useful in the workflow between Illustrator and After Effects since it automates the task of creating layers for each shape and renaming them. 

For Adobe Illustrator. 

### Usage
1 Select the parent layer (containing your named subitems)  
2 Go to *File > Other Scripts*  & choose ""SubItem2LayerName.jsx"  
3 Ta-Da!
